# 🧠 SpamVision — AI-Powered Spam & Phishing Detection Suite

**Author:** Bharath R  
**Version:** 1.0  
**License:** MIT  

SpamVision is a next-generation, AI-driven **spam and phishing defense system** built to protect users across **SMS and Gmail** communication channels. It combines **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **LLM-based NLP** to intelligently detect, explain, and prevent modern spam threats — from **smishing** to **AI-generated phishing**.

## 🚀 Overview

SpamVision isn't just a spam filter — it’s an **intelligent defense engine** that understands human language, behavior, and deception tactics.  
It uses a **multi-stage hybrid architecture**:

- ⚙️ **Heuristic + Rule-based filtering** for instant triage  
- 🧮 **Bayesian & ML classifiers** for adaptive learning  
- 🧠 **Deep NLP (BERT, LSTM)** for semantic and contextual analysis  
- 🌐 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for contextual reasoning  
- 🔍 **Anomaly detection** to identify impersonation and behavioral deviations  
- 🧩 **Cross-channel protection** for SMS, Email, and QR-based (Quishing) threats
